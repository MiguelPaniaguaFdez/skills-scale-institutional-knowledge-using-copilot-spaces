# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- **Timebox**: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- **Facilitator**: Typically Scrum Master or Project Manager
- **Attendees**: Full delivery team (Developers, QA, UX, DevOps, Product Manager)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure psychological safety—focus on processes, not people
- Document outcomes and share with team within 24 hours

## Retrospective Formats

### Format 1: Start, Stop, Continue
- **Start**: What should we begin doing?
- **Stop**: What should we stop doing?
- **Continue**: What's working well that we should keep doing?

### Format 2: Sailboat
- **Wind**: What's helping us move forward?
- **Anchor**: What's slowing us down?
- **Rocks**: What risks are ahead?
- **Island**: What's our goal/destination?

### Format 3: 4Ls
- **Liked**: What did we enjoy or appreciate?
- **Learned**: What new insights did we gain?
- **Lacked**: What was missing or could be better?
- **Longed For**: What do we wish we had?

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template
- **Title**: [Brief, specific description]
- **Description**: [What needs to change and why]
- **Owner**: [Name and role]
- **Due date**: [Specific date or sprint]
- **Success criteria**: [How we'll know it's done and effective]
- **Priority**: [High / Medium / Low]

Example:
- **Title**: Improve PR review turnaround time
- **Description**: PRs are sitting in review for 2+ days, slowing feature delivery. Establish a 24-hour review SLA.
- **Owner**: Tech Lead
- **Due date**: Next sprint
- **Success criteria**: Average PR review time < 24 hours for 4 consecutive weeks
- **Priority**: High

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items and share results with team
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Create a safe environment for experimentation and learning
- Share learnings across teams through demos or documentation
- Review long-term trends (velocity, quality metrics, team satisfaction)
- Encourage team members to propose experiments and process changes
